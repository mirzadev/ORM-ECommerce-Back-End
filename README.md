## User Story

```text
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```text
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
```

## Associations

*I have executed association methods on my Sequelize models to create the following relationships between them:*

- Product belongs to Category, as a category can have multiple products but a product can only belong to one category.

- Category has many Product models.

- Product belongs to many Tag models. Using the ProductTag through model, allow products to have multiple tags and tags to have many products.

- Tag belongs to many Product models.
